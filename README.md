# OSC Relay

## Running OSC Relay

Until a build is made, to run OSC Relay fun the following in terminal:

```
npm run start
```

Open [this starter sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/mngyuan/sketches/hA9CeepA-) and run it to connect to the websocket.

Send some OSC messages - you can use `utils/osc-simple.py` to get started. They should appear in the main window of OSC Relay and in the console in the p5.js editor.
